## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

BidOptimizer is a Python application designed to process Excel files. It loads an input Excel file, executes predefined calculations using an internal calculator module, and outputs the processed data back into an Excel file.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repo-url>` with the URL of this repository.

2. Navigate to the project root directory (where `setup.py` is located).
3. Install the project and its dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After installation, you can run the application from the command line with:

```bash
bidoptimizer --input <path-to-input-excel-file> --output <path-to-output-excel-file>
```

This command will run the `main` function of the `main.py` file in the `src` directory, as defined in `setup.py`. The main function should handle the flow of the program, including loading the Excel file, performing calculations, and writing the output back to an Excel file.
